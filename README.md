# Largest-Square-Problem
The task is to find the largest square on a map while avoiding obstacles. Given a map file, replace empty spaces with full ones to represent the largest square possible. Multiple solutions are handled by placing the square as high and left as possible. The program accepts 1 to n parameters and includes a Makefile for compilation.
