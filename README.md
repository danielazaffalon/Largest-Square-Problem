# Largest-Square-Problem
This program finds the largest square on a map by avoiding obstacles. With the ###examples/perl program you can generate a square of given dimensions and obstacle density (```./examples/perl.sh 100 100 2```) By passing the file to the bsq program (```./bsq example.ox```) or via standard input (```./examples/perl.sh 100 100 2 | ./bsq``` or ```cat example.ox | ./bsq```), the program replaces empty spaces with filled spaces to represent the largest possible square. Multiple solutions are handled by placing the square as high and to the left as possible. The program accepts 1 to n parameters and includes a Makefile for compilation.
